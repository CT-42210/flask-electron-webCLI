# flask-electron-webCLI

built by taking [jQuery Terminal](https://terminal.jcubic.pl/) and throwing it in to flask and electron

deprecated from an AlgoTrading project, I realized an SSH connection is a better use of my time

also has a secret-less session auth system for passwords I wrote using C++ (and thus passwords are in theory unreadable)
